            <h4>Many affordable private schools have tried to retain their senior teachers and have possibly let go their less-experienced ones. Most schools may be trying to fill the gap by asking existing teachers to teach multiple classes.</h4>

            <p class="list-group-item-text col-lg-7 col-md-7 col-sm-7 col-xs-12">Maya Menon, founder-director, Teacher Foundation, said it’s possible that recently recruited teachers have left schools or shifted careers. “Many affordable private schools have tried to retain their senior teachers and have possibly let go their less-experienced ones. Most schools may be trying to fill the gap by asking existing teachers to teach multiple classes,” she said.
                Schools in cities seem to be coping better as they have got more applications for jobs than the usual. “While some of our teachers left for better paying jobs, it wasn’t difficult to find replacements this time,” said Tanuja Monappa, principal of Mary school in Mysuru. “Usually, we find it difficult to get people in June and July. This time, there were plenty of freshers approaching us for jobs.”

            <h4>These guest faculty themselves are teachers who quit from another school because of non-payment of salaries</h4>
            <img src="school_design-6.jpg" class="img-responsive col-lg-5 col-md-5 col-sm-5 col-xs-12">
            <p class="list-group-item-text col-lg-7 col-md-7 col-sm-7 col-xs-12">Staff at Sherwood High Bengaluru, said they have roped in two guest teachers to ensure students are taught online. “These guest faculty themselves are teachers who quit from another school because of non-payment of salaries,” said Ramesh CA, principal. “They now freelance and conduct online classes for many schools like mine. I have told them we will divide whatever fees we get equally amongst all of us. We need some system to keep ourselves going.”
                Private schools point out that their inability to collect fees has affected payment of salaries for teachers. “Many schools have cut salaries and some have not been able to pay anything,” said D Sashi Kumar of Associated Managements of Primary and Secondary Schools in Karnataka. “In many cases, teachers found their salaries too low after the reduction. Besides that, many did not want to go to school to take online classes as they were scared of contracting the infection. Some went back to their hometowns, while others had to stay at home because their children were home. We do not know whether they will return once schools reopen.”
